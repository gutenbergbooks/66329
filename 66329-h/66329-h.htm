<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">It</span> seems like a paradox to speak of the Negro as efficiently
related to the cause of freedom in America. He was
brought here and forced into slavery, in which condition he
was held most of the time since the country was settled.
He was treated not as a human being, but as property to be used only
for the advantage of his oppressors. Some became free, but North as
well as South, they were largely shut out from the opportunities for industry
and general improvement of their condition. They were under
a social ban and not recognized as equal to their fellowmen of a different
complexion. After suffering from such treatment for generations
it could hardly be expected that Negroes would feel much enthusiasm
in the cause of popular liberty on account of the wrongs they suffered,
and the seeming hopelessness of ever getting their rights.</p>

<p>But notwithstanding this the colored man displayed an intense love
of freedom, and a willingness to fight and make sacrifice for the common
cause of human liberty, even when his own prospect of sharing
in it, was not promising. White men, generally assuming that they
had the special right to the monopoly of that blessing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span></p>

<p>In this the Negro showed a magnanimity and noble manhood,
never surpassed by those of any other race. The time is coming
when due justice will be done to our African brothers by the patriotic
historian, which has not yet been accorded.</p>

<p>It would require volumes to record what the colored man has
done for the cause of liberty in this country. A presentation of a few
of the facts cannot but tend to fire our patriotism as well as revive in
our memories the important part our colored country-men have acted
in achieving the liberties we now enjoy.</p>

<p>In 1770 an important event took place in Boston. There was a
massacre on King Street now called State. Several men were shot by
British soldiers. The most conspicuous figure there was Crispus
Attucks, a Negro, who lost his life. Years before he had been a slave
in Framingham and escaped from his master. Several advertisements
were published in the <i>Boston Gazette</i>, with ample rewards for his
capture; but he was not seized. Twenty years after he came to Boston.
When the British soldiers were insulting and oppressing the true
American patriots, Attucks appeared as the leader to the first resistance
to their tyranny. On March 5th, 1770, Attucks as the leader
shouted: “The way to get rid of these soldiers is to attack the main
guard; strike at the root, there is the nest.” When the British
soldiers fired, Attucks was the first to fall. The body of this hero
with that of another who fell, lay in Fanueil Hall, while others were
buried from their homes. The funeral was said to have been the
largest ever known in this country. Daniel Webster said: “From
that moment we may date the severance of the British Empire.”</p>

<p>At the battle of Bunker Hill, Major Pitcairn was killed, which
proved to be a serious loss to the British. It was he who was the chief
commander of the forces that went out to Lexington and Concord at
the time of the famous fight there. He fell at the hands of private
Peter Salem of Colonel Nixon’s regiment of the Continental Army.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
This Negro soldier’s claim to this honor could not be disputed. There
was another Negro soldier who distinguished himself, Salem Poor,
and displayed such valor that fourteen American officers called the
attention of Congress to his merits. The memorial was dated at Cambridge,
December 5, 1775, and stated “that under our own observation,
we declare that a Negro man called Salem Poor, of Colonel
Frye’s regiment, Captain Ames’ company, in the late battle at Charlestown
behaved like an experienced officer as well as an excellent soldier.
To set forth the particulars of his conduct would be tedious.
We would only beg leave to say, in the person of this said Negro,
centres a brave and gallant soldier. The reward due to so great and
distinguished a character we submit to the Congress.”</p>

<p>The army organized at Cambridge under General Washington,
had from the start colored men in it. The historian Bancroft states
that free Negroes stood in the ranks by the side of white men. All
through the Revolution the colored man performed a very important
part, for which very little credit has ever been given him.</p>

<p>At the battle of Long Island in 1776, Negroes fought bravely,
and many fell. Theodore Parker, once in alluding to the discovery
of the remains of these, remarked: “Now after seventy-five
years have passed by, the bones of the forgotten victims of the
Revolution are shovelled up by Irish laborers, carted off, and shot
into the sea, as rubbish of the town. Had they been white men’s
relics, how they would have been honored with sumptuous burial
anew, and the purchased prayers and preaching of Christian divines!
Now they are the rubbish of the street.”</p>

<p>In the war of 1812, the Negro performed heroic service on land and
on the water. Commodore Perry said that Negroes in the navy
seemed to be absolutely insensible to danger. General Jackson gave
them great credit for their efficient services. He solicited and welcomed
them into the service of their country. In September, 1814, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
issued a proclamation, which contained the words: “As sons of freedom,
you are now called upon to defend our most inestimable blessing.
As Americans your country looks with confidence to her adopted
children for a valorous support.”</p>

<p>In the war of the Rebellion the colored man performed a very
prominent and heroic part. This furnished on a large scale an opportunity
to show his loyalty and courage, and he met the highest expectations
which had been cherished by his friends.</p>

<p>For two years the war had been carried on by the North on the
principle of saving the Union without interfering with slavery, which
was really at the bottom of the whole trouble. While that policy was
pursued the prospect of success seemed dark. Slaves in several cases
ran away and came into the Union forces for protection, but in several
instances were sent back. General Butler after awhile declared that
kind of property to be contraband of war. After that the rebels did
not have many of the “contrabands” forced back by our soldiers.
After the proclamation of emancipation was issued, victory seemed to
turn on the side of the Union forces, and defeat on the other side.
That step for the freedom of 4,000,000 of slaves, was announced as an
act of justice and a military necessity.</p>

<p>On the side of the North, negroes for a considerable time had not
been allowed to use a shovel or shoulder a musket in behalf of the
cause of freedom. Some predicted that if so allowed they would not
begin to compare in efficiency with the white man. The experiment
proved a grand success.</p>

<p>One of the most joyous days of my life, was that in which the first
Negro regiment marched through the streets of Boston, after having
been reviewed on the Common. That was the Massachusetts Fifty-fourth,
which made such a noble record afterwards. This was in May,
1863. Four flags were presented to it, one by young colored ladies
of Boston; a national ensign presented by a society of colored ladies;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
another by ladies and gentlemen friends of the regiment; and another
flag by relatives of the late Lieut. Putnam. One of the emblematic
banners had inscribed on it: “Liberty, Loyalty and Unity.” This
regiment did noble service for their country. General Strong said of
the Negro troops that charged on Fort Wagner: “The Fifty-fourth
did well and nobly, only the fall of Colonel Shaw prevented them
from entering the fort. They moved up as gallantly as any troops
could, and with their enthusiasm they deserve a better fate.”</p>

<p>Generally the Negro troops acquitted themselves most creditably as
soldiers. Stanton, Secretary of War, said of them at Petersburg:
“The hardest fighting was done by the black troops. The parts
they stormed were the worst of all. After the affair was over,
Gen. Smith went to thank them, and tell them he was proud of their
courage and dash. He says they cannot be exceeded as soldiers.”</p>

<p>There were in all 178,975 Negro soldiers in the United States Volunteers,
and of these 38,847 were killed, wounded and missing. They
took part in 449 battles. Besides the large military force there were
150,000 Negro laborers in other departments. When Cincinnati was
threatened with an invasion, 706 colored citizens volunteered to construct
military roads and fortifications, and were known as “The
Black Brigade of Cincinnati.” Many of the members afterwards
entered military service. Had I space I might speak of the brilliant
achievements of Robert Small and others on the sea. Of William
Tillman the <i>New York Tribune</i> said: “To this colored man was the
nation indebted for the first vindication of its honor on the sea.”</p>

<p>The Negro has two elements in his nature which render him specially
susceptible to civilization and patriotism, namely, the religious sentiment
and music. Without these there cannot be an exalted patriotism.
During the Rebellion the colored people of the South had as by a
sort of inspiration an impression that they were going to be freed.
They sang and prayed with that idea before them. They believed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
that “Father Linkum” was to be their Moses, and they would soon
be set at liberty. Under the influence of this they were patient and
hopeful. They prayed for the success of the Northern army, and
their songs were inspired by the love and hope of freedom.</p>

<p class="p_last4">I will conclude by mentioning an incident which occurred on old
Fort Plantation, Port Royal. There was a grove there of live oaks,
in one of which was a seat, on which a Boston minister had sat while
writing a book on the beauties of slavery, called the “South-side
View.” On the first day of January, 1863, the commanding officer
of the Union forces appointed a meeting in that grove, at which the
declaration of emancipation would be read. There was quite a program
marked out, but which was somewhat interrupted by a remarkable
incident. When the proclamation was read, the many Negroes
present suddenly broke out singing the national hymn: “My country
’tis of thee; Sweet land of liberty.” That hymn they never could
sing before, and now that they were free they sang it with swelling
hearts; but how they learned it was unknown. Their hearts thrilled
with joy at the thought of being free, and rose in gratitude to God.</p>
